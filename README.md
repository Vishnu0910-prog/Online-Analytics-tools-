Online analytics Tools using Java Full Stack:
The project aims to develop a robust full-stack development for the creation 
and management of “ONLINE ANALYTICS TOOL” and it is designed by using 
Visual Studio Code, built with Spring Boot, using MySQL on the backend and 
Node.js for the frontend. It ensures a responsive and intuitive user interface for 
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ). This application incorporates features like 
automated scoring, efficient result generation, and performance tracking for each 
student. Security is enhanced with JWT-based authentication, while the system 
is designed for scalability, capable of handling large volumes of student data and 
assessments with high performance. Additionally, it provides customizable 
analytics, offering insights into individual and group performance for instructors.

The Student Answer Module of the Online Examination System offers a 
seamless and efficient solution for students to participate in exams, submit their 
answers, and receive real-time feedback. The module provides a user-friendly 
interface where students can log in securely, access assigned question papers, and 
submit their responses. With features like real-time answer saving, time 
management, and immediate result generation, the module ensures a smooth test- 
taking experience. Upon submission, the answers are securely stored and 
evaluated, and students can view their scores instantly, along with detailed 
feedback. A key improvement over existing systems is that students can view the 
entire question paper on a single page, rather than being limited to viewing only 
two questions per page with a "next" option. This enables students to answer the 
questions they are confident about first and then return to the others after additional 
consideration, offering flexibility and reducing exam-related stress. Built with 
Spring Boot on the backend and Node.js on the frontend, the system offers secure 
and scalable performance, with JWT-based authentication ensuring that only 
authorized users can participate in exams. Faculty members can easily create 
question papers with various formats, while students benefit from a clear, 
responsive interface for managing their exams. Overall, the Student Answer 
Module streamlines the online test process, providing an efficient, secure, and 
user-friendly platform for the students.
